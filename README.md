### Synopsis

The Fizzyo Gaming Project is a physiotherapy inspired computer gaming project that is designed for people with Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder. Patients suffering Cystic Fibrosis undergo a life-long treatment called CF physiotherapy, which requires them to do physio-exercises using a dedicated breathing equipment every day. The project is a collaboration between UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Healthâ€™s physiotherapy department (ICH), Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Charity, Microsoft and BBC Make it Digital.

### Motivation

Fishyo is designed for patients suffering from Cystic Fibrosis. It utilizes the Fizzyo device, which is a physiotherapy equipment that is included in the treatment of the symptom. Fishyo takes inspiration from Gold Digger, which is a simple and addictive one-button video game. We hope that Fizzyo will help patients engage in their treatment.

### Description

Fishyo is an one-button fishing game, in which the blows into the Fizzyo device ins transformed into the game control. For each blow into the device, the in-game player will make a "hook", allowing the payer to fish different types of fish in the oceans. The game has no penalty, which means every blows count, and there is different levels correspond with faster hook, faster and more diverse type of fish. The game also have a collection, although being at an early stage development, allows the players to record the type of fish they have caught.

### Deployment

Using the code in this github repository and the Unity launcher, you can play the game by open the source code via Unity, select File -> Build for UWP.

### Takeway

This is a project that helps us to work on our own programming skills, to know how to adapt our work based on clients' requirement, and to collaborate efficiently as a team. We hope that you enjoy our Fishyo game.
