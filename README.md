##Synopsis

The Fizzyo Gaming Project is a physiotherapy inspired computer gaming project that is designed for people with Cystic Fibrosis, a genetic disorder. Patients suffering Cystic Fibrosis undergo a life-long treatment called CF physiotherapy, which requires them to do physio-exercises using a dedicated breathing equipment every day. The project is a collaboration between UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Healthâ€™s physiotherapy department (ICH), Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Charity, Microsoft and BBC Make it Digital.
